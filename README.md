Simple project messing around with weather API provided by the [national weather service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

Start the server with the following command
``` uv run flask run ```
Then navigate to localhost:5000 to view the site!

### Project Goals
1. Have the 5 day weather forecast displayed. (Done)
2. Choose a location.
3. Get alerts.
